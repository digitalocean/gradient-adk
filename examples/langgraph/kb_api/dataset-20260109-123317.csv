"{""prompt"": ""What is secure sign-in for teams and how do I enable it?""}","Secure sign-in is a team setting that requires each team member to sign in to their DigitalOcean account using either 2FA, Google SSO, or GitHub SSO. This adds an additional layer of security for all team members.
To enable secure sign-in, navigate to your [team settings](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/team) in the control panel. This setting ensures that all team members use secure authentication methods when accessing your team's resources.
"
"{""prompt"": ""What are the predefined roles available in DigitalOcean teams?""}","DigitalOcean teams come with six predefined roles: **Owner**, **Biller**, **Billing Viewer**, **Member**, **Modifier**, and **Resource Viewer**.
Each role has different levels of access: - **Owner**: Full access to shared resources, billing information, and team settings - **Biller**: Full access to billing information only, no access to shared resources or team settings - **Billing Viewer**: Limited read-only access to billing information, no access to shared resources or team settings - **Member**: Full access to shared resources, read-only access to team settings, no access to billing - **Modifier**: Full access to shared resources except delete operations, read-only access to team settings, no access to billing - **Resource Viewer**: Read-only access to shared resources and team settings, no access to billing
For more details, see the [predefined roles documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/teams/roles/predefined/).
"
"{""prompt"": ""Can I create custom roles for my DigitalOcean team?""}","Yes, you can create custom roles for your DigitalOcean team. Custom roles allow you to create roles with only the specific permissions you choose, providing more granular control than the six predefined roles.
# Key Features - Custom roles are available at no cost - No limit to the number of custom roles you can create - You can modify permissions after creating a custom role - Team members can be assigned custom roles the same way as predefined roles
# Important Considerations - Custom roles can only be created in the control panel (not via API or doctl) - New product permissions are not automatically added to custom roles - You cannot delete a custom role if team members are currently assigned to it - Custom roles cannot be copied between teams
For step-by-step instructions, see [How to Use Custom Roles](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/teams/how-to/use-custom-roles/).
"
"{""prompt"": ""How do I create a custom role for my team?""}","To create a custom role for your team:
1. **Switch to your team** in the control panel by clicking the team icon and selecting ""Switch Teams"" 2. **Navigate to Settings** → **Role Access** tab 3. **Click ""Create Custom Role""** to start the three-step process:
**Step 1: Create New Role** - Enter a name and description for the role - Select the permissions you want to include - Required permissions are automatically added (e.g., read permissions for resources you can modify)
**Step 2: Related Permissions** (optional) - Review and optionally add suggested related permissions - These are not required but may be useful
**Step 3: Assign Role** (optional) - Select existing team members to assign to this new role - You can skip this and assign members later
After creation, you can edit the role's permissions or delete it from the Role Access tab using the ""..."" menu.
# Note You cannot delete a custom role if team members are currently assigned to it.
For step-by-step instructions, see [How to Use Custom Roles](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/teams/how-to/use-custom-roles/).
"
"{""prompt"": ""What's the difference between a Member and Modifier role?""}","The key difference between Member and Modifier roles is their access to delete operations:
**Member Role:** - Full access to shared resources (including delete operations) - Read-only access to team settings - No access to billing information
**Modifier Role:** - Full access to shared resources **except delete operations** - Read-only access to team settings - No access to billing information
Both roles have identical access to team settings and billing (read-only and no access respectively). The Modifier role is designed for team members who need to create and modify resources but should not be able to delete them, providing an additional safety layer.
For more information, see the [predefined roles documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/teams/roles/predefined/).
"
"{""prompt"": ""Can a Billing Viewer see all billing information?""}","No, a Billing Viewer has limited read-only access to billing information. They can view most billing information on the Billing page tabs, such as payment methods and promos.
However, **Billing Viewers cannot view billing settings** on the Settings tab of the Billing page.
For full access to all billing information including billing settings, a team member needs the Biller or Owner role.
For more information, see the [predefined roles documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/teams/roles/predefined/).
"
"{""prompt"": ""What happens to API token permissions based on team roles?""}","Personal access tokens for the DigitalOcean API inherit their permissions from your team role. When Read Only and Full Access tokens scopes are selected, the permissions of your team role control the scopes available to your API tokens.
# Key Points - Personal access tokens are unique to the person who generated them - Your team role determines what API scopes your tokens can access - If your team role changes, it affects what your existing API tokens can do
# Example If you have a Resource Viewer role (read-only access), your API tokens will only have read-only scopes available. If you're promoted to a Member role (full access), your API tokens will then have access to create, update, and delete scopes. If Custom Scopes were selected when generating the token, the token will maintain the selected scopes even if your team role changes.
For more information about API tokens and scopes, see the [API documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/).
"
"{""prompt"": ""How do I create a new team on DigitalOcean?""}","To create a new team, click the profile icon in the top right of the DigitalOcean Control Panel to open the drop-down menu, then click **Create a Team**.
The creation process has three steps: 1. **Team Info**: Enter the team name and contact email 2. **Add Payment Method**: Enter payment information (skipped if you already have a payment method) 3. **Invite Team Members**: Optionally invite people via email or skip to remain on a team of one

Once you switch teams, you'll be working within that team's context and can access that team's resources, billing information, and settings based on your role permissions.
"
"{""prompt"": ""What's the difference between teams and organizations on DigitalOcean?""}","Teams are how you manage your infrastructure and billing on DigitalOcean. Each team is billed separately and has its own payment information. You can group related teams into organizations for consolidated billing, payment, and invoicing.
# Recommendation Use teams to organize resources and collaborate with others, and use [organizations](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/organizations/) when you need consolidated billing across multiple teams.
"
"{""prompt"": ""What happens when I change someone's role to owner on my team?""}","When an owner changes someone else's role to owner, a special confirmation process occurs:
1. The original owner receives an email with a link to confirm the change 2. Once they confirm the change, the invited owner receives an email invitation to accept the new role 3. The role change only takes effect after both confirmations are completed
This two-step process ensures that ownership changes are intentional and verified by both parties.
"
"{""prompt"": ""What is Single Sign-On (SSO) and what protocols does DigitalOcean support?""}","Single sign-on (SSO) is authentication mechanism that lets users access multiple applications by signing in once with a single set of credentials. An identity provider (IdP) is an authentication service that manages user identities for applications.
SSO on DigitalOcean supports OIDC-compatible IdPs, like Okta. When a logged-out user tries to access an SSO-enabled app, the app redirects the user to the IdP to authenticate using secure protocols like SAML or OpenID Connect (OIDC).
For more information, visit [Single Sign-On for DigitalOcean Teams](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/teams/settings/single-sign-on/).
"
"{""prompt"": ""How do I enable SSO on my DigitalOcean team?""}","To enable SSO on your DigitalOcean team, first configure your IdP, then configure SSO on DigitalOcean.
Switch to your team in the control panel, click the profile icon → **Switch Teams** → select your team. From the team settings page, in the **Single sign-on (OIDC)** section, click **Enable**.
You'll need to provide three pieces of information: - The **OpenID provider URL** - The **OpenID client ID** - The **OpenID client secret**
After entering these values, click **Test SSO config to continue** to verify your provider URL is valid before proceeding to the next configuration page.
For detailed setup instructions, see [How to Configure Single Sign-On for Teams](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/teams/how-to/configure-sso/).
"
"{""prompt"": ""Can I enforce SSO as the only sign-in method for my team, and what are the risks?""}","Yes, you can enforce sign-in via SSO only, which prevents team members from signing in to DigitalOcean with other login methods like email and password.
During SSO setup, use the **Enable sign-in via SSO only** checkbox to make your selection. If you don't enforce SSO during initial setup, you can enable it later on your team settings page.
# Recommendation Test your SSO login before enforcing sign-in via SSO. If SSO is misconfigured and enforced as the only sign-in method, you cannot log into your team and will need to contact support.
For setup guidance, see [How to Configure Single Sign-On for Teams](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/teams/how-to/configure-sso/).
"
"{""prompt"": ""How do I configure role mapping between Okta groups and DigitalOcean team roles?""}","To configure role mapping, create a group in Okta for each role (predefined or custom) that you use on your DigitalOcean team, then assign the application to each group.
For each role on your DigitalOcean team: 1. From the Okta admin console, expand **Directory** → click **Groups** 2. Click **Add group** and name it with `DO:` prefix followed by the DigitalOcean role name (e.g., `DO:Owner`) 3. Click **Save** to create the group 4. Click the group name → **Applications** tab → **Assign applications** → select your app → **Assign** → **Done**
You must also configure the Groups claim expression in your Okta app's **Sign On** tab to remove the `DO:` prefix and pass the role name as `team_role`.
For detailed instructions, visit [How to Configure Single Sign-On for Teams](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/teams/how-to/configure-sso/).
"
"{""prompt"": ""How do I disable SSO on my DigitalOcean team?""}","To disable SSO on a team, switch to the team in the control panel by clicking the profile icon → **Switch Teams** → select your team.
In the left menu, click **Settings** to go to the team settings page. In the **Single sign-on (OIDC)** section, click the **...** menu, then click **Disable**. In the confirmation window, click **Disable SSO**.
Your SSO configuration is saved even when disabled, so you may re-enable it at any time.
For more information, see [How to Configure Single Sign-On for Teams](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/teams/how-to/configure-sso/).
"
"{""prompt"": ""Where can I view SSO activity and login history for my team?""}","To view SSO activity, switch to your team in the control panel (profile icon → **Switch Teams** → select team).
In the left menu, click **Settings** to go to the team settings page. In the **Single sign-on (OIDC)** section, click **Show more**, then click **View SSO Activity** to go to the SSO activity page.

"
"{""prompt"": ""What's the difference between SAML and OIDC for SSO, and which should I use?""}","Both SAML and OpenID Connect (OIDC) are secure protocols used for SSO authentication, but they serve different purposes:
**OIDC (OpenID Connect)**: Supported by DigitalOcean Teams, works with OIDC-compatible IdPs like Okta. This is the protocol used for DigitalOcean Teams SSO configuration.
**SAML**: Used by Paperspace Teams, compatible with SAML 2.0 specs and works with identity providers like Google or Auth0.
# Recommendation For DigitalOcean Teams, use OIDC-compatible identity providers. For Paperspace Teams, use SAML-compatible providers. The choice depends on which DigitalOcean service you're configuring.
For DigitalOcean Teams setup, see [How to Configure Single Sign-On for Teams](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/teams/how-to/configure-sso/). For Paperspace, see [How to Enable Single Sign-On (SSO) for Paperspace Teams](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/paperspace/accounts-and-teams/enable-sso/).
"
"{""prompt"": ""I'm getting an error when testing my SSO configuration. What should I check?""}","When testing SSO configuration fails, verify these common issues:
**Check your OpenID provider information**: - Ensure the **OpenID provider URL** is correct (e.g., `https://example-application.okta.com`) - Verify the **OpenID client ID** and **client secret** are accurate - Confirm the **Sign-in redirect URI** is set to `https://cloud.digitalocean.com/sessions/sso/callback`
**Verify Okta app configuration**: - Grant type should be set to **Authorization Code** - Remove default `localhost` URI from Sign-out redirect URIs - Check that Groups claim expression is properly configured if using role mapping
# Recommendation Test each component individually: first verify your IdP configuration, then test the connection from DigitalOcean. If issues persist, double-check that your provider URL is a valid OIDC provider before proceeding.
For troubleshooting guidance, see [How to Configure Single Sign-On for Teams](https://docs.digitalocean.com/platform/teams/how-to/configure-sso/).
